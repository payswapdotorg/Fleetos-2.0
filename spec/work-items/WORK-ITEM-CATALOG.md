# FleetOS 2.0 Work Item Catalog

## Execution contract

Every item must include:

- objective;
- owned paths;
- dependencies;
- acceptance tests;
- deliverable evidence;
- rollback/recovery expectations.

Work items are the durable execution backlog. The TL dispatches from this file.

## Wave 0 — Repository conversion / architecture substrate

### F200A — FleetOS repository identity and ZCode substrate boundary
Owner: A

Convert ZCode identity assumptions in edge/runtime-facing surfaces into FleetOS-neutral abstractions without breaking inherited runtime behavior.

Acceptance:
- FleetOS naming is canonical at repository/product boundaries;
- upstream ZCode-only identity is isolated;
- runtime still boots;
- tests/builds pass.

### F200B — Canonical FleetOS contracts + bounded-context skeleton
Owner: B

Create contracts and package skeletons for the FleetOS domain kernel, Guardian, capabilities, missions, evidence and intelligence.

Acceptance:
- public contracts exist;
- dependency checks enforce boundaries;
- no domain implementation depends on UI/runtime internals.

### F200C — Work/control/commercial domain skeleton
Owner: C

Create work, project, workload, procurement, vendor, software, agent-organization and model-gateway bounded-context skeletons.

Acceptance:
- public contracts;
- tenant-aware interfaces;
- no business truth in ZCode runtime packages.

### F201 — TL architecture-governance harness
Owner: TL

Make FleetOS architecture rules executable:
- architecture policy;
- ownership validation;
- dependency report;
- work-item verification;
- contract snapshot;
- source-of-truth checks;
- repository freshness/consistency commands.

Dependencies: F200A/B/C.

## Wave 1 — Kernel and persistence

### F210A — Identity/Tenancy/Actor kernel
A

### F210B — Guardian/Capability/Action/Evidence kernel

### F210C — Mission/Workflow/Work/Project application kernel
C

### F211 — Transactional persistence + outbox + repository ports
TL

Dependencies:
- F201
- F210A/B/C

Parallelism:
F210A, F210B, F210C run concurrently.

## Wave 2 — Assets and operational truth

### F220A — ManagedAsset + DeviceTwin + Observation ingestion
A

### F220B — Security/Health/Recovery/Execution composition
B

### F220C — Workloads/Projects/Procurement/Vendor/Software
C

### F221 — Control-plane command bus + durable mission runtime
TL

Parallelism:
F220A/B/C fully concurrent after Wave 1 public contracts freeze.

## Wave 3 — Edge + intelligence

### F230A — FleetOS Edge Agent
A

Capabilities:
- enrollment;
- trust;
- telemetry;
- diagnostics;
- local evidence;
- command inbox;
- reconciliation.

### F230B — Predictive Twin + World Model
B

Capabilities:
- deterministic reference model;
- provenance;
- uncertainty;
- counterfactuals;
- model adapter seam;
- tenant/privacy enforcement.

### F230C — Agent Organization + Model Gateway
C

Capabilities:
- agent roles;
- capability budgets;
- model routing;
- provider fallback;
- organization configuration.

### F231 — Intelligence/application convergence
TL

Parallelism:
F230A/B/C concurrently; F231 after all three.

## Wave 4 — Experience

### F240A — Asset/field/mobile experiences
A

### F240B — Security/Guardian/Predictive experiences
B

### F240C — Work/Projects/Commerce experiences
C

### F241 — FleetOS Control Tower + universal command/search
TL

All three worker experience lanes run concurrently.
F241 converges after contracts are stable but may scaffold in parallel.

## Wave 5 — Integration ecosystem

### F250A — ADCOS + connectivity adapters
A

### F250B — Arena + learning/evaluation adapters
B

### F250C — Aurum + Apify + vendor/external adapters
C

### F251 — Integration health/convergence/retry/idempotency
TL

All three adapter lanes run concurrently.

## Wave 6 — Simulation and optimization

### F260A — Operational simulation worlds
A

### F260B — Predictive evaluation/replay/safety benchmarks
B

### F260C — Agent organization optimization
C

### F261 — FleetOS Engineering Lab product shell
TL

All three simulation lanes run concurrently.

## Wave 7 — Product acceptance

### F270A — Device/field acceptance journeys
A

### F270B — Security/action/intelligence acceptance journeys
B

### F270C — Work/commerce/project acceptance journeys
C

### F271 — Full industry adoption simulation + deployment acceptance
TL

Minimum acceptance population:
- 10 industries;
- small/medium/large firms;
- 30 real workspaces;
- 7 personas where applicable;
- 100+ repeatable journeys per firm where supported;
- mobile validation for every industry;
- cross-role handoffs;
- incumbent capability baseline;
- SWITCH-ONLY / MAIN-INTERFACE / COMPLEMENT / RETAIN verdicts.

## Wave 8 — Hardening and scale readiness

### F280A — Edge hardening / offline / fleet-scale ingestion
A

### F280B — Security, audit, replay, disaster recovery
B

### F280C — Commerce, SLA, vendor marketplace, production economics
C

### F281 — Production release gate / observability / cost controls
TL

## Wave 9 — Future industrial intelligence

Only start after the core product acceptance gate.

### F290A — Asset lineage / material / method graph
A

### F290B — Advanced world models / JEPA-family adapter implementations
B

### F290C — Industry-specific agent organizations and optimization
C

### F291 — Industrial intelligence convergence
TL

## Concurrency rules

- Tasks without explicit dependency edges are parallelizable.
- TL should keep workers continuously supplied with ready work.
- Workers may pre-build tests, fixtures, adapters, schemas and migration plans for their next item while blocked, but must not violate dependency contracts.
- A worker may not "reserve" a task by leaving code in another worker's ownership path.
- Every merged worker lane must reduce, not increase, integration uncertainty.
